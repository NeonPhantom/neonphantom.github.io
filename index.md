## Hi Everybody!

My name is Grant, and I am a GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile technology) major at BSU with minors in Computer Science and Business Bridge to Career.

### Game Design

Due to being enrolled in the GIMM major, I have experience in video game design.
Here is a video of a half-finished game that I am currently working on: [The Honor Guard](https://youtu.be/aTWHIt1GwwU)
It will be fully completed by this Christmas! (2019)

### Music

Along with my major and minors, I also have a passion for music, and I am a self-taught composer.

If you would like to listen to some of my music, check out my Youtube channel: [Grant Heffner Music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoozf-OkNY72iU-wf5acteA).
